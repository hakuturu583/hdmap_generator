//! `roadgen-sumo` — writes the canonical IR as a SUMO network.
//!
//! # Which SUMO format this is
//!
//! SUMO's simulator reads a `.net.xml`, and a `.net.xml` is a *build product*: it
//! carries the shape of every junction, the internal lane through every movement and
//! the right-of-way matrix that decides who waits for whom, all of it computed by
//! `netconvert`. Writing one directly would mean reimplementing netconvert, and
//! getting it subtly wrong.
//!
//! So what is written here is netconvert's own input — the **plain XML** network:
//!
//! | file | what is in it |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `<name>.nod.xml` | junctions and road ends, as points |
//! | `<name>.edg.xml` | one edge per direction of travel, with its lanes |
//! | `<name>.con.xml` | which lane may be left for which lane |
//! | `<name>.netccfg` | the netconvert run that turns the three into a `.net.xml` |
//!
//! ```text
//! netconvert -c <name>.netccfg
//! ```
//!
//! That is the format a network *generator* is expected to produce, and it is the
//! one SUMO documents for the purpose.
//!
//! # What a SUMO edge is
//!
//! A one-way bundle of lanes. A road carrying traffic both ways is therefore two
//! edges, pointing at each other, and the IR's reference line — which has no
//! direction as far as traffic is concerned — becomes the thing they are both
//! measured against. Lanes within an edge are numbered from the **right** in the
//! direction of travel, which is index 0, so the numbering of the same physical lane
//! differs between the two carriageways. That is SUMO's convention and not a choice
//! made here.
//!
//! A road whose cross-section changes becomes one edge per cross-section, joined at
//! an internal node: a SUMO edge has one lane count from end to end.
//!
//! Every lane is written with its own shape, so the geometry the generator computed
//! is the geometry SUMO gets — not a centreline with a width, which is what a
//! network imported from OpenStreetMap has to make do with.
//!
//! # Junctions
//!
//! The IR draws a junction as a set of connector roads, one per movement. SUMO draws
//! it as a *node*: the arms stop at its edge, and netconvert generates an internal
//! lane for every connection across it. The two models agree about what matters —
//! the enumerated movements — so the connectors are not written as edges. Each one
//! becomes the `<connection>` that says its approach lane may be left for its exit
//! lane, and netconvert draws the path.
//!
//! This is why the arms are left exactly where the IR puts them, short of the
//! junction: the gap is the junction, and netconvert fills it.
